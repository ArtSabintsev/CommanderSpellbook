# Commander Spellbook: The Premiere Commander/EDH Combo Database

The Commander Spellbook website was created to catalogue and centralize all reasonable [Magic: the Gathering combos](https://magic.wizards.com/en) (for singleton formats) and to make them easily available across all digital modern platforms. 

The idea started off as a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DkAyVJG) in February 2020. Once we reached 5000+ members and 1000+ combos in May 2020, we began working on a website.

At present, this repository is the OSS version of the website, which itself is a GitHub page. 

- The temporarily URL for the site is: https://sabintsev.com/CommanderSpellbook.
- The database is hosted on Google Sheets at:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJo8MzkpuhfvsaKVFVlOoNymscCt-Aw-1sob2IhpwXY/edit#gid=0. 
- The Google Sheets API for all the combos can be found at: https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/1JJo8MzkpuhfvsaKVFVlOoNymscCt-Aw-1sob2IhpwXY/values:batchGet?ranges=combos!A2:P&key=AIzaSyDzQ0jCf3teHnUK17ubaLaV6rcWf9ZjG5E
